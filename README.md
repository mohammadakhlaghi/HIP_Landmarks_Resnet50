# HIP Landmarks Detection using ResNet50

This repository contains the implementation of a **two-stage ResNet50-based model** for detecting hip geometrical landmarks in X-ray images. This model builds upon the work in the **HipLandmarkDetection** project by Mahdie Aghasi, which utilized a VGG-based approach. By leveraging ResNet50, our method achieves improved accuracy in detecting anatomical landmarks crucial for hip measurements.

## 📌 Overview
Hip anatomical landmark detection plays a key role in **preoperative planning for hip replacement arthroplasty**. Precise localization of these landmarks enables accurate measurement of hip parameters, leading to better surgical outcomes.

## 🔬 Research Publication
